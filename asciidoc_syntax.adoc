AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language, similar to Markdown. We chose AsciiDoc over standard Markdown because it provides more out-of-box capabilities. While it's more powerful, it's still simple to use. Refer to this page to get started writing in AsciiDoc.

See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[AsciiDoctor User Manual^] for additional help.

== The basics

You need to know a few things to contribute simple doc updates.

=== Headings

....
= Page title
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section
===== Level 4 section
....

You can have only one page title, but you can have multiple section titles. For example, you might have three level 1 sections that include level 2 and 3 sections:

....
= Page title
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
== Level 1 section
== Level 1 section
=== Level 2 section
==== Level 3 section
....

=== Bold text

....
*Text*
....

=== Italic text

....
_Text_
....

=== Bulleted lists

....
* Item 1
+
Continuation text for the previous list item.

* Item 2
** Item 2a

* Item 3
....

TIP: The + is a list continuation. It keeps the text inline with the list item. Omitting the + affects the formatting of that line.

=== Labeled lists

....
Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2
....

or

....
[horizontal]
Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2
....

When you add [horizontal] above item 1, the label and description appear on the same line. That works well when you have very short descriptions.

*Example without [horizontal]*

Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2

*Example with [horizontal]*

[horizontal]
Item 1::
Description 1

Item 2::
Description 2

=== Steps

....
.Steps

. Step 1

. Step 2
+
Info for step 2

. Step 3
.. Step 3a
.. Step 3b

. Step 4
....

TIP: The + is a list continuation. It keeps the text inline with the list item. Omitting the + affects the formatting of that line.

=== Images

....
image::file.gif[alt text]
....

TIP: "alt text" means alternative text. It describes the image that appears on the page. The primary use is for visually-impaired users who use screen readers.

=== Videos

Hosted on YouTube:

....
video::id[youtube]
....

Hosted locally in GitHub:

....
video::file.mp4
....

=== Links

The syntax that you should use depends on what you're linking to:

* <<Link to an external site>>
* <<Link to a section on the same page>>
* <<Link to another page in the docs>>

==== Link to an external site

....
url[link text^]
....

The ^ opens the link in a new browser tab.

==== Link to a section on the same page

....
<<section_title>>
....

For example:

....
For more details, see <<Headings>>.
....

The link text can be something other than the section title:

....
<<section_title,Different link text>>
....

For example:

....
<<Headings,Learn the syntax for headings>>.
....

==== Link to another page in the docs

The file needs to be in the same GitHub repository:

....
link:<file_name>.html[Link text]
....

To link directly to a section in the file, add a hash (#) and the section's title:

....
link:<file_name>.html#<section-name-using-dashes-and-all-lower-case>[Link text]
....

For example:

....
link:style.html#use-simple-words[Use simple words]
....

=== Notes, tips, etc.

You might want to draw attention to certain statements by creating notes or tips. Format them as follows:

....
NOTE: text

TIP: text

IMPORTANT: text

CAUTION: text

WARNING: text
....

Use each of these sparingly. You don't want to create pages that are full of notes and tips. They become less meaningful if you do.

Here's what each of these looks like when the AsciiDoc content is turned into HTML:

NOTE: This is a note. It includes extra info that a reader might need to know.

TIP: Here's a tip. A tip provides useful information that can help a user do something or understand something.

IMPORTANT: This is important information that the reader must be aware of so they don't do something that they shouldn't.

CAUTION: A caution advises the reader to act carefully. Use this in rare circumstances.

WARNING: And this is a warning that informs of danger or harm. This one should be used very rarely, as well.

== Advanced stuff

If you're authoring new content, you'll want to review this section for some nitty-gritty details.

=== Document headers

Each AsciiDoc file includes two types of headers. The first is for GitHub and the second is for AsciiDoctor, which is the publishing tool that turns the AsciiDoc content into HTML.

The GitHub header is the very first set of content in the .adoc file. It needs to include the following:

....
---
sidebar: sidebar
permalink: <file_name>.html
keywords: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4, keyword5
summary: A summary.
---
....

The keywords and summary directly affect search results. In fact, the summary itself displays in the search results. You should make sure that it's user friendly. The best practice is to have the summary mirror your lead paragraph.

The next header goes directly underneath the document title (see <<Headings>>). This header should include the following:

....
:hardbreaks:
:nofooter:
:icons: font
:linkattrs:
:imagesdir: ./media/
....

You won't need to touch any of the parameters in this heading. Just paste it in and forget it.

=== Lead paragraph

The first paragraph that appears under the document title should include the following syntax directly above it:

....
[.lead]
This is my lead paragraph for this content.
....

[.lead] applies CSS formatting to the lead paragraph, which has a different format than the text that follows it.

=== Tables

Here's syntax for a basic table:

....
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| heading column 1
| heading column 2
| row 1 column 1 | row 1 column 2
| row 2 column 1 | row 2 column 2
|===
....

There are _many_ ways to format a table. Refer to the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables[AsciiDoctor User Manual^] for additional help.

=== Task headings

If you're explaining how to perform a task, you might include introductory information before you get to the steps. And you might need to say what to do after completing the steps. If you do, it's best to organize that information using headers, which enables scanning.

Use the following headings as needed:

.What you'll need

_The information the user needs to complete the task._

.About this task

_Some extra contextual info the user might need to know about this task._

.Steps

_The individual steps to complete the task._

.What's next?

_What the user should do next._

Each of these should include a . right before the text, like so:

....
.What you'll need
.About this task
.Steps
.What's next?
....

This syntax applies bold text in a larger font.

=== Command syntax

When providing command input, enclose the command within ` to apply monospace font:

....
`volume show -is-encrypted true`
....

Here's what that looks like:

`volume show -is-encrypted true`

For command output or command examples, use the following syntax:

....
----
cluster2::> volume show -is-encrypted true

Vserver  Volume  Aggregate  State  Type  Size  Available  Used
-------  ------  ---------  -----  ----  -----  --------- ----
vs1      vol1    aggr2     online    RW  200GB    160.0GB  20%
----
....

The four dashes enable you to enter separate lines of text that appear together.
Here's the result:

----
cluster2::> volume show -is-encrypted true

Vserver  Volume  Aggregate  State  Type  Size  Available  Used
-------  ------  ---------  -----  ----  -----  --------- ----
vs1      vol1    aggr2     online    RW  200GB    160.0GB  20%
----

=== Code syntax highlighting

Code syntax highlighting provides a developer-focused solution for documenting the most popular languages.

*Output example 1*

[source,http]
POST https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com/oauth/token
Header: Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
              "username": "<user_email>",
              "scope": "profile",
              "audience": "https://api.cloud.netapp.com",
              "client_id": "UaVhOIXMWQs5i1WdDxauXe5Mqkb34NJQ",
              "grant_type": "password",
              "password": "<user_password>"
}

*Output example 2*

[source,json]
[
    {
        "header": {
            "requestId": "init",
            "clientId": "init",
            "agentId": "init"
        },
        "payload": {
            "init": {}
        },
        "id": "5801"
    }
]

*Supported languages*

* bash
* curl
* https
* json
* powershell
* puppet
* python
* yaml

*Implementation*

Copy and paste the following syntax and then add a supported language and the code:

....
[source,<language>]
<code>
....

For example:

....
[source,curl]
curl -s https:///v1/ \
-H accept:application/json \
-H "Content-type: application/json" \
-H api-key: \
-H secret-key: \
-X [GET,POST,PUT,DELETE]
....

=== Images with links

You can add a link to an image so it acts like a "button."

*Output example*

image::image_with_link.gif[An image of a button that says "View in Documentation Center"]

Use the following syntax when adding your image:

....
image:<file_name>.<ext>[alt=<text>,link=<url>,window=_blank]
....

"window=_blank" opens the link in a new browser tab (or window).

For example:

....
image:btn-view-in-doc-center.png[alt=A button titled View in Documentation Center that links to the NetApp HCI Doc Center,link=http://docs.netapp.com/hci/index.jsp,window=_blank]
....
