The documentation for NetApp's products and services is open source. This enables you to contribute to the content by making improvements, corrections, and suggestions. All you need is a GitHub account and a little initiative.

== Overview

You can contribute to our docs by using the following options:

* Click *Request doc changes* to submit general feedback or to ask a question about the content. The NetApp content lead then reviews your request to determine what changes are needed to the docs. This is the most common option.
+
<<Request doc changes,View step-by-step instructions for this option>>.

* Click *Edit this page* to directly edit the content yourself. The NetApp content lead then reviews your edits and merges them.

== Request doc changes

Submitting a request for a doc change is the most common way to contribute to NetApp docs. After you submit the request, the content lead will confirm that they've received your feedback. You'll get an email notification from GitHub when they do.

If the content lead agrees that your suggestion can make the content better, they will commit the change shortly after that. You'll receive another notification that your feedback was incorporated.

TIP: All comments that you provide are publicly visible. Anyone who navigates to the issues in the GitHub repo can see your comments.

== Submit edits to the docs

If you're comfortable editing the content yourself, you can submit the exact doc changes that you'd like to see by directly editing the source file.

As an outside contributor, you won't be able to publish the change directly. The content lead will review the changes, make any required edits, and then merge the changes. You'll get an email notification from GitHub when this happens.
